## About

This plugin adds a custom widget to augment the [PT Courtyard theme](https://precisethemes.com/courtyard/), providing a basic page include function for the home screen.

This is a modified version of [PT About Widget](https://precisethemes.com/docs/courtyard/).  It *requires* the  Courtyard theme to be active in order to work as expected.

## Installation

1. Zip this directory:
```sh
# Mac, Linux instructions only
zip -r courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin.zip courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin -x *.git*

2. Follow instructions https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Add_New_Screen#Upload_Plugins to manually upload the plugin ZIP `courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin`.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Use the plugin as you would the "PT: About" plugin.
