## About

Basically a modified version of PT About Widget.  It *requires* the Precise Themes "Courtyard" theme to be active to work as expected.

## Installation

1. Zip this directory:
```sh
# Mac, Linux instructions only
zip -r courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin.zip courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin -x *.git*
```
2. Follow instructions https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins_Add_New_Screen#Upload_Plugins to manually upload the plugin ZIP `courtyard-page-include-widget-plugin`.
3. Activate the plugin.
4. Use the plugin as you would the "PT: About" plugin.
